I’m a Ph.D canditate in Computer Science and Engineering at University at Buffalo, State University of New York, USA and expect to defend by May 2019. I’ve received my M.Sc. in Computer Scicence from the University of Campinas, Brazil and my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the University of Pernambuco, Brazil.

In my dissertation, we have proposed methods to perform distributed autonomous construction in unstructured environments and have designed a heterogeneous robotic system that allows us to effectively evaluate these methods at a physical implementation level. In our application, the robots were tasked to change the environment, through deposition of irregular/deformable building material,  to turn non-navigable areas into navigable ones, allowing robots to reach otherwise inaccessible regions. This work was a finalist for the Best Systems Paper Award at the 2018 Robotics Conference: Science and Systems (RSS). My research contribution is to design construction models that can be mapped correctly to physical implementations and to leverage autonomous construction systems to operate in highly irregular environments.


My research interests are in autonomous systems, bio-inspired robotics, robotic-vision, multi-robot systems, distributed robotics systems, autonomous construction, navigation. I have experience in developing theoretical frameworks, high-level system designs and working with system implementations.
